--Welcome to your final assessment test! This will test your knowledge of the previous section, 
--focused on creating databases and table operations. 
-- This test will actually consist of a more open-ended assignment below:

--Complete the following task:

--Create a new database called "School" this database should have two tables: teachers and students.
--The students table should have columns for student_id, first_name,last_name, 
homeroom_number, phone, email, and graduation_year.
--The teachers table should have columns for teacher_id, first_name, last_name,
--homeroom_number, department, email, and phone.

--The constraints are mostly up to you, but your table constraints do have to consider the following:
     --We must have a phone number to contact students in case of an emergency.
     --We must have ids as the primary key of the tables
     --Phone numbers and emails must be unique to the individual.
