SELECT bookings.starttime AS "start", 
facilities.name AS "name"
FROM cd.facilities
INNER JOIN cd.bookings ON 
bookings.facid = facilities.facid
WHERE "name" LIKE 'Tennis%' AND 
bookings.starttime > '2012-09-20 23:59:59' AND 
bookings.starttime < '2012-09-22 00:00:00'
ORDER BY bookings.starttime ASC;

SELECT starttime AS start, name 
FROM cd.facilities
INNER JOIN cd.bookings ON 
bookings.facid = facilities.facid
WHERE TO_CHAR(starttime, 'YYYY-MM-DD') = '2012-09-21'
